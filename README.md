# recursion-project
The Odin Project task to use recursion to solve Fibbonacci and Merge Sort problem.

## Skills Used
- Practice logic with recursive and iterative versions of functions
- Use node to run code in command line
- Implement logic with Merge Sort algorithm

## Keep in Mind
- Creating variables without `let` or `const` will cause them be created at wrong scope (global)
