# recursion-project
The Odin Project task to use recursion to solve Fibbonacci and Merge Sort problem.

## Skills Used
- Implement logic with recursive and iterative versions of popular algorithms
- Use node to run code in command line
- Debug recursive functions with breakpoints
- Practice recursive functions with multiple base cases and recursive calls

## Keep in Mind
- Creating variables without `let` or `const` will cause them be created at wrong scope (global)
